//--Self Notes.--


// I want to know how many common, uncommon, rare, and legendary items are in the inventory.

//Ok how do we tell which one is uncommon or rare or lengendary?

//hmm I might need to check again how UDItem is structured.

// Val 0 = Common
// Val 1 = Uncommon.
// Val 2 = Rare.
// Val 3 = Legendary.

//If Enums are immutable we just have to created a temporary one based one that category.


//1.Create a dictionary that keeps a count of how many items in the inventory are Common, Uncommon, Rare, and Legendary.
//2.For each item in the inventory, determine its rarity and then add one to the running count for that rarity.
//3.Return the dictionary.

//-- Procedure says return the dictionray. But it is Enum type. I am guessing Enum and Dictionary types are interchangeable??

// Creating Var assign enum becomes dictionary type.
